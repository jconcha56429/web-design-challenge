This is my first attempt at a web-design page. For this assignment I mostly focused on getting everything to work. 
I frist struggled with attempting to make my own navigation button and found it to be possible with a very long
and complex style structure. However I found a much easier way to do it with navbar from bootstrap. It took me 
a while to understand all of the documentation, but it was a very satisfying process to get everything to work
and understanding boot strap will certainly be a big part of my career. I can't wait to work more with html, and 
will certainly revisit this challenge in the future to get my website to look even better.
