<h1>Analysis of Latitude vs. Humidity</h1>
<img src = "Resources/assets/images/Fig2.png">
<p> This graph displays Latitude vs. Humidity. This graph isn't as easy to read as the one before it, however based
    off if it we can make a few assumptions. Just by looking at it, there doesn't seem to be a very strong correlation
    either way. There does seem to be a cluster of data located in the higher latitude and higher humidity, where as 
    the lower end of these factors has less data. Still though much of the data is scattered all over this graph.
    Despite this it would be fair to assume that the data on this graph can represent a positive correlation with 
    much of the data inside the 100% humidity.
