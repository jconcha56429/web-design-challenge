<h1>Analysis of Latitude vs. Wind Speed</h1>
<img src = "Resources/assets/images/Fig4.png">
<p> This graph showing the relationship between latititude and wind speed looks as though it could potentially 
    be a positive correlation because of the data scattered in the form of a high tail. However, just based on
    the visual represtation of this graph it's especially hard to tell with tons of the data scattered in the 
    bottom of the plots.
